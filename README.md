### Hi, I'm Kolade! 👋

I am a **Web Software Developer student** at **Blackhawk Technical College** in Wisconsin.

Before moving into tech, I worked in manufacturing. Now, I am using that experience to learn how to build software that solves real-world industrial problems. My focus is on **C#** and web development, and I plan to transfer to **Lakeland University** to finish my Bachelor's in Computer Science after graduation.
